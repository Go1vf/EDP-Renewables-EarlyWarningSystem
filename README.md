In our project, we focused on improving the predictive accuracy of wind turbine defaults through the use of advanced data mining techniques and a diverse array of machine learning models. Our approach was based on thorough data preprocessing and feature engineering, complemented by the deployment of several models, including Isolation Tree, Support Vector Machine
(SVM), Vanilla Neural Network, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
